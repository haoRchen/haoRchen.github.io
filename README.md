# Personal Portfolio Website Version 1

A personal project for myself to learn more about Front-End web development. Also, a portal to present my tech related activities. 

Outcome of learning: 

1. High fidelity prototyping with Sketch App(Mac OS).
2. I started the project with basic knowledge of CSS. By the end, I learned how to use:
    * Sass
    * Flexbox
    * Transitions
    * Animations
    * Experimented with a wide variety of Tags, pseudo classes and elements. 
3. DOM manipulation with Javascript and deeper understanding of Vue lifecycle. 

The following are goals for version 2 of the portfolio:

1. Accessibility in websites.  
2. Adhere more strickly to BEM style for Sass.
3. Dive deeper into Vue.js and use Vuex for state management. 
4. Smaller and more modular Vue components
5. Creative site layout and Motion for UX.
