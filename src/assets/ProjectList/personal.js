It has the functionality for users to upload or created documents with Latex, tagging contents, admin management and authentication. This is the capstone project of which I collaborated with two of my peers at Seneca College. Instead of using .NET and SQL, we decided to take on an entire tech stack to challenge ourselves. My tasks includes leading front-end development using Vue.js, setting up API end-points and data schema. The capstone was completed over the course of 8 months. With bi-weekly sprints and learning new technologies on top of other coursework, my colleagues and I greatly improved on time management skills."
