      "A 4 month Co-Op term where I was part of many projects, all of which is Front-End related. 1. The main project I completed was a SPA Co-Op website using TypeScript, HTML and Sass. 2. Completed features and styling for an internal style guide web app using React.js, Redux.js and Sass. 3. Worked on an internal Idea sharing web app where I created and styled components(React and Context). Also, I made calls to .NET back-end to send and retrieve data."
